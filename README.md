This project integrates blockchain technology with machine learning to securely store and analyze patient health data. It collects various health metrics, stores them in an immutable blockchain, and uses linear regression models to predict future health outcomes.

How It Works:
Collect Input: User enters health details.
Store Data: Data is securely stored in a blockchain.
Train Models: Linear regression models predict future health metrics.
Make Predictions: System predicts future cholesterol levels and heart rates.
Output Results: Prints health data, predictions, and the blockchain.
